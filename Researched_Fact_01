Recent findings regarding the influence of sad mood on music preference have been inconsistent, with some research suggesting that sadness 
promotes selective exposure to happy music and other work suggesting the very opposite. In three experiments, we investigated whether this 
discrepancy may have resulted from differences in the extent to which sadness was elicited by having participants think about personally 
relevant versus personally irrelevant negative events. To this end, we manipulated sad mood via a guided visualization technique in which 
participants were led to imagine experiencing a loss that was relevant either to their own or to an unfamiliar individual's concerns. 
Results revealed that irrespective of the self-relevance of the mood induction, individuals in sad, relative to happy, or neutral moods 
preferred to avoid expressively happy music. This aversion was partially mediated by beliefs that choosing happy music while sad would be 
inappropriate and thereby ineffectual in mood repair. Together, these findings contribute to resolving discrepancies in the literature and 
help advance understanding of the influence of mood on music choice.
